# Lab 8 - Starter

## 1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed

A GitHub action could automatically run test cases upon code pushes, allowing for continuous integration of code that passes all of the test cases. Choosing to manually run tests would be inefficient, and defeart the purpose of automatic testing.

## 2. No

Checking if a function returns the correct output would be tested via a unit test.

## 3. No

It would be too difficult to create unit tests to test a complex feature such as messenging, since there are too many components that have to interact with each other.

## 4. Yes

Testing the max length of a message would be fit for a unit test, since it is a small scale component, that doesn't have to interact with too many other components.
